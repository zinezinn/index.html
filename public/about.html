  tributes to the coastal beauty of the area.
 originally a small fishing village, howth has grown to be a major coastal area with a busy fishing port. the town,with its maritime
influences and historics roots, is full of variety,with wild moorland, and stunning cliff and coastal wallks with easy reach.</p>
